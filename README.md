Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify complex datasets by transforming them into a smaller set of new variables called principal components. 
These components are linear combinations of the original features, capturing the most variance in the data while minimizing redundancy. 
PCA is commonly used in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization to reduce noise, improve interpretability, and speed up algorithms.
Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset helps reduce the four-dimensional data (features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) to two dimensions for easier visualization and analysis, while retaining most of the data's variability.
Key Insights:
1. Variance Explained: PCA reveals how much variance each principal component captures. For example, the first two components explain around 97% of the variance.
2. Visualization: By projecting the data onto 2D space, clusters corresponding to different species become visible, helping with classification or clustering tasks.
This technique reduces noise and makes data easier to visualize without significantly losing information.
